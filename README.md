## Directions

This project is focused on exploratory data analysis, aka "EDA". EDA is an essential part of the data science analysis pipeline. Failure to perform EDA before modeling is almost guaranteed to lead to bad models and faulty conclusions. What you do in this project are good practices for all projects going forward.

We will be looking for the following things:

- For statistics questions, Python code -- using pandas, numpy, scipy, and/or other libraries -- to calculate correct answers, with Markdown explaining your results
- For plotting questions, labeled seaborn or matplotlib plots displayed within your notebook, with Markdown interpreting the results
